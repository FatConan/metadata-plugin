<strong>Search for the projects that fit the Metadata in the query string.</strong>
<p>The query only handles equals right now, more query features will be added in later versions.</p>
<p>Example query string: <strong>job.last.saved.time=2012-08-20</strong></p>
<p>This will result in listing all the projects that were saved the 20th August 2012.</p>
<p>Look at the Metadata tab of a project to see what can be searched for.</p>
